# Tasks done :

1. The required part (game flow, navigation, "game over" alerts) 
2. Twitter sharing using Social.framework
Sharing button is visible only when there is a twitter account stored in the system settings (no user engagement done at this point)
Sharing button is visible for any game result. However, I've implemented the logic to enable it only for games that ended up with winning. 
Hopefully, I got the bonus task right.

3. Turn indicator label for better UX
4. MVVM pattern has been used

5. Dependency injection has been used 
Injecting to constructors for busyness logic classes.
Injecting to properties for UI classes.

6. Unit test coverage for ViewModel and Model classes
7. User interface has been designed using a storyboards.
During the call I did math approach since I thought it was a bit time consuming to drag all constraints. In orther words, I was under stress.
8. UIStoryboardSegue approach has been used for navigation
9. Extra features have been developed using "git flow"
10. The repository contains tags for major milestones
